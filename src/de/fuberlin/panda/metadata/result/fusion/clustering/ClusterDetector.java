/**
 * This class is basically an implementation of the OPTICS-OF algorithm developed by
 * Mihael Ankerst, Markus M. Breunig, Hans-Peter Kriegel and JÃ¶rg Sander. It detects
 * clusters in a set of data by augmented ordering the entries and assign them to 
 * clusters regarding their outliner factors. <br><br>
 * 
 * For a closer look on the OPTICS algorithm check the paper "OPTICS: Ordering Points To 
 * Identify the Clustering Structure".
 * For more information about OPTICS OF check the paper "OPTICS-OF: Identifying Local Outliers".
 * You can find both papers by a simple google search.
